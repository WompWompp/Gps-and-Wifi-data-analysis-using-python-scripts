GPS and WiFi data analysis using Python scripts

Hi, this is my first data analysis project using Python scripts. I did some experiments with the data that I created. 
For a better, more readable, and functioning structure, I separated the files so you can run the main and see the analysis in text format, and for the charts based on data, you need to run chart files.
